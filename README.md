PeerDrop is a modern, secure, and easy-to-use file sharing platform featuring real-time, peer-to-peer transfers with end-to-end encryption. Built to ensure your files are shared safely and swiftly, PeerDrop is split into two main parts: a **Frontend** built with React and TypeScript, and a **Backend** written in Go to power real-time communication via WebSockets. Enjoy a seamless experience whether you're sharing sensitive documents or your latest creative project! 🔒💻

## 📜 Project Workflow

### 1. User Interaction Flow

- **Room Creation** 🏠  
  The host creates a room, and a unique 6-digit room ID is automatically generated. This ID is used to invite others to join the session.
  
- **Joining a Room** 👥  
  Clients can easily join an existing room using the room ID. The host is promptly notified when new participants join.
  
- **File Transfer** 📂  
  The host sends files in chunks (Base64 encoded), and these chunks are instantly broadcast to all connected clients, ensuring a real-time sharing experience.
  
- **Room Closure** 🚪  
  When the host disconnects, all clients receive a notification, and the room is gracefully closed.

### 2. Real-Time Communication

- **WebSockets** 🌐  
  Real-time data transfer is achieved using the WebSocket protocol. Our backend efficiently manages room creation, participant management, and file chunk broadcasting to ensure a smooth and synchronized experience for all users.

## 🔥 API Endpoints

- **WebSocket Endpoint**  
  `ws://localhost:8080/ws`  
  This endpoint is used for all room operations, including creation, joining, and file transfers.
  
- **Test Endpoint**  
  `http://localhost:8080/hello`  
  Use this endpoint to perform a quick health check and ensure that the backend server is up and running. It returns a JSON message confirming server connectivity.
